      <br />
      These terms and conditions (“Terms”) have been established by Plottables
      (“we”, “our”, or “us”). By using our website,{" "}
      <a href="https://plottables.io">https://plottables.io</a> - including any
      subdomains, or interacting with associated smart contracts (collectively
      the “Site”, “Application”, “Services”, or “Smart Contract”) you (“You”,
      “User”, or “Collector”) expressly agree to comply with all terms and
      conditions of these Terms. Please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:contact@plottables.io"> contact@plottables.io</a> for any
      questions or issues.
      <br />
      <br />
      These terms of use set forth the legally binding terms and conditions that
      govern your use of the site. By accessing or using the site or
      application, you are accepting these terms of use (on behalf of yourself
      or the entity that you represent), and you represent and warrant that you
      have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these terms of use
      (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent). If you do not
      agree with all of the provisions of these terms of use, do not access
      and/or use the site. These terms of use require the use of arbitration
      (section 17) on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury
      trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in
      the event of a dispute.

        User Responsibility for Ethereum Wallet / Address
      </div>
      <br />
      In order to use the Site, you must connect or sign with an Ethereum wallet
      (“Wallet”) to the Site. You represent and warrant that you are the
      exclusive owner and controller of the Wallet. You are responsible for
      maintaining the confidentiality of any financial information related to
      your Wallet. Any user that connects or signs to the site with their wallet
      expressly agrees to comply with all terms and conditions of these terms.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.container}>Modification of the Site</div>
      <br />
      Plottables reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or
      discontinue the Services and/or Site (in whole or in part) with or without
      notice to you. You agree that Plottables will not be liable to you or to
      any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of
      the Site or any part thereof.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.container}>Modification of the Smart Contract</div>
      <br />
      Plottables reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or
      discontinue the Smart Contract, and to mandate migration to a new version
      of the Smart Contract where Plottables deems it appropriate. Plottables
      will give one week’s notice of any proposed migration through Plottables’s
      social media channels including the Site.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.container}>Indemnification</div>
      <br />
      You agree to indemnify and hold Plottables (and its officers, employees,
      and agents) harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any claim
      or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of
      the Site, (b) your violation of these Terms of Use, or (c) your violation
      of applicable laws or regulations. Plottables reserves the right, at your
      expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for
      which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with
      our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without
      the prior written consent of Plottables. Plottables will use reasonable
      efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon
      becoming aware of it.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.container}>Fees</div>
      <br />
      Plottables reserves the right to charge a fee on secondary sales through
      the Smart Contract or third-party markets, up to 15% of the purchase
      amount.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.container}>Assumption of Risk</div>
      <br />
      You accept and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for determining
      what, if any, taxes apply to your purchases and sales on the Smart
      Contract. Plottables is not responsible for determining the taxes that
      apply to your Smart Contract transactions. By making any purchases, you
      are purchasing ownership of a token hash that is stored on the Ethereum
      blockchain and used to generate artwork. The site does not store, send, or
      receive tokens. The source code used to generate artwork from your token
      hash is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Under no circumstances do you
      have ownership of this source code. Plottables is not responsible for any
      bugs, exploits, or hacks. We cannot guarantee that the Site or Smart
      Contract is free of bugs or errors. There are risks associated with
      accepting cryptocurrencies as payment and purchasing blockchain based
      Tokens, including but not limited to, the risk of losing private keys,
      theft of cryptocurrency or Tokens due to hackers finding out your private
      key, lack of a secondary market, significant price volatility, hard forks
      and disruptions to the Ethereum blockchain. You accept and acknowledge
      that transfers on the Ethereum blockchain are irreversible and as a
      result, it is not possible for Plottables to issue refunds on Token
      purchases.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.container}>Release</div>
      <br />
      You hereby release and forever discharge Plottables (and our officers,
      employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and
      relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim,
      controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of
      action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and
      property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of,
      or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Application. If you are a
      California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542
      in connection with the foregoing, which states: “A general release does
      not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or
      suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release
      and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or
      her settlement with the debtor or released party.”
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.container}>Limitation of Liability</div>
      <br />
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall Plottables be
      liable to you or any third party for any lost profits, lost data, or any
      indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive
      damages arising from or relating to these terms of use or your use of, or
      inability to use, the site, even if Plottables has been advised of the
      possibility of such damages. Access to, and use of, the site is at your
      own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage
      to your device or computer system, or loss of data resulting therefrom.
      Plottables shall not be liable for any loss or damage as a result of your
      failure to keep your wallet secure. Plottables shall not liable for any
      loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality
      of your financial information, which includes your private keys. To the
      maximum extent permitted by law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
      contained herein, our liability to you for any damages arising from or
      related to this agreement (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the
      form of the action), will at all times be limited to a maximum of fifty us
      dollars (u.s. $50). The existence of more than one claim will not enlarge
      this limit. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of
      liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation
      or exclusion may not apply to you.
